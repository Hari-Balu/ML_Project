# 🎓 Performance Prediction: End-to-End with Deployment
![Student Performance Prediction UI](assests/Performance%20Prediction.png)

This project explores how various socio-demographic factors influence student performance (test scores) using supervised machine learning. From data preprocessing to model deployment, the goal is to predict student scores based on features such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and participation in test preparation courses.

---

### 🔍 Problem Statement

Understanding student performance is critical in education analytics.  
This project aims to **predict student test scores** using input features like:

- Gender  
- Race/Ethnicity  
- Parental level of education  
- Lunch (standard/reduced)  
- Test preparation course  

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Model**: Linear Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost  
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit / Flask  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud / Render / Heroku  
- **Notebook Interface**: Jupyter Notebooks  

---

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Key insights from the data**

- **Parental education** and **test preparation** have a significant impact on scores.  
- Students who completed a **test preparation course** tend to perform better.  
- There are score disparities across **ethnic groups and genders**.  
- Lunch type (standard vs. free/reduced) correlates with overall test performance.

2. **Visuals include**
- Box plots, Histograms, Heatmaps, Correlation matrices

### 🧠 ML Pipeline

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Categorical encoding
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling

2. **Model Training**
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, R²

3. **Model Selection**
   - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
   - Best model saved as `model.pkl`

---

### 🌐 Deployment

The final model is deployed using **Streamlit**, creating an interactive web app where users can input student details and get a **predicted score**.

---
### 🌱 Future Improvements
- Add feature importance visualizations
- Use SHAP for explainability
- Try classification-based framing (e.g., grade category prediction)
- Integrate MongoDB or Firebase for storing input/output data
- Add model versioning with MLflow

### 🙌 Ideal For
- Data Science Portfolio Projects
- Educational Research Analytics
- Deployment Practice with Streamlit
- Interview preparation (EDA → Modeling → Deployment flow)
